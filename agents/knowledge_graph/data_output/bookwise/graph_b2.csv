dopamine|craving|Scientists can track cravings by measuring dopamine levels in the brain. Experiments in 1954 revealed the role of dopamine in craving and desire. Blocking dopamine release in rats led to loss of will to live, eat, and reproduce. Follow-up studies showed rats could experience pleasure without dopamine, but lacked desire. Flooding the brain with dopamine led to rapid habit formation in animals. Dopamine is one of many factors in habit formation, but crucial for desire and craving.|976be5a13da44a02bc60eb95dd5d1ef7
